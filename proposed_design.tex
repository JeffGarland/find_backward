\section{Proposed Design}

\subsection{Design}

This paper proposes to introduce only the \code{std::range} overloads of the
functions \code{find_backward()}, \code{find_if_backward()},
\code{find_if_not_backward()}.  The following synopsis has interface details.
Note that the iterator-based overloads do not take an iterator-sentinel pair;
this is not suitable for an algorithm that operates in reverse.
