\section{Proposed Design}

\subsection{Design}

This paper proposes to introduce iterator-based and range-based overloads of
the functions \code{find_backward()}, \code{find_not_backward()},
\code{find_if_backward()}, \code{find_if_not_backward()}, and
\code{find_not()}.  The following synopsis has interface details.  Note that
the iterator-based *\code{_backward} overloads in namespace \code{ranges} do
not take an iterator-sentinel pair; this is not suitable for an algorithm that
operates in reverse.  \code{find_not()}, being the only forward-operating
algorithm proposed, does have a sentinel-accepting overload.
